## URL Shortener


##### Assignment:

Make an HTTP service that serves to shorten URLs, with the following functionalities:
- Register web address (API)
- Redirect client according to shorten URL
- Visits statistic

##### Assignment description:

##### 1. Basic architecture

The service should have two parts: configuration and user.

##### 1.1 Configuration part

The configuration part is invoked using REST calls with JSON payload and is used for:

    a) Opening of accounts
    b) Registration of URLs in the 'Shortener' service
    c) Displaying stats

##### a) Opening accounts

Request parameters | Details and examples
--- | ---
HTTP method | POST
URI | /account
Request Type | application/json
Request Body | JSON object with following parameters:<ul><li>`AccountId (String, required)`</li></ul>*Example: {"AccountId : "myAccountId"}*
Response Type | application/json
Response | We distinguish the successful from the unsuccessful registration. Unsuccessful registration occurs only if the concerned account ID already exists. The parameters are as follows: <ul><li>`success: true or false`</li><li>`description: Description of status, for example: account with that ID already exist`</li><li>`password: Returns only if the account was successfully created. Automatically generated password length of 8 alphanumeric characters.`</li></ul> *Example {"success":"true", "description":"Your account is opened", password: "xC345Fc0"'}*

##### b) Registration of URLs

Request parameters | Details and examples
--- | ---
HTTP method | POST
URI | /register
Request Type | application/json
Request Headers | <b>Authorization</b> header with Basic authentication token
Request Body | JSON object with following parameters:	<ul><li>`url (mandatory, url that needs shortening)`</li><li>`redirectType : 301 or 302 (not mandatory, default 302)`</li></ul> *Example: {"url": 'http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1567929/website-safe-data-access-architecture-question?rq=1', redirectType:301}*
Response Type | application/json
Response | Response parameters in case of successful registration are as follows: <ul><li>`shortUrl (shortened URL)`</li></ul> *Example: {shortUrl:'http://short.com/xYswlE'}*

##### c) Retrieval of statistics

Request parameters | Details and examples
--- | ---
HTTP method | GET
URI | /statistic/{AccountId}
Request Headers | Set <b>Authorization</b> header and authorize user
Response Type | application/json
Response | The server responds with a JSON object, <b>key:value</b> map, where the key is the registered URL, and the value is the number of this URL redirects. *Example: {'http://myweb.com/someverylongurl/thensomedirectory/:10, 'http://myweb.com/someverylongurl2/thensomedirectory2/:4, 'http://myweb.com/someverylongurl3/thensomedirectory3/:91}*

##### 1.2	Redirecting

Redirecting the client on the configured address with the configured http status.

##### 2. General requirements

-	Use Java programming language
-	Pay attention that the response http statuses comply with the REST standards (list status http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html).
-   Service should be written as 'executable' or as 'deployable' package of your choice (eg war,jar).
-   The application should not require any additional (external) configuration, meaning it should not have dependencies that arenâ€™t declared in POM.
-   The application should work out of the box, on first run without any aditional configuration.
-   In accordance with the above claim, it is not allowed to use databases unless they are embedded, therefore, built into the application itself.
-   It is allowed to use any framework.
-   Make a help page (url: /help) containing instructions for installation, launching and usage
-   Deliver the source code with all dependencies for Java, preferably as a Maven project

Important note: send your solution through a link on cloud-based sites (Drobpox, Bitbucket, GitHub, WeTransfer, etc..), or otherwise we will not be able to receive it due to possible system safety issues.
